## The Challenge

The challenge consists in daily coding practice, where i'm going to dedicate part of my day do produce programming related stuff, like solving some code online judges exercises or working on a side project. Of course, everything while searching for job.

## In Practice

To start, i'll be doing LeetCode exercises and working on some unfinished projects:

- [Second Brain](https://github.com/caioopr/second_brain)
- [Ixtore](https://github.com/caioopr/ixtore)
- [Productivist Ecosystem](https://github.com/caioopr/productivist_ecosystem)
- [Library Management System](https://github.com/caioopr/library_management_systems)
- [Miahbits](https://github.com/caioopr/Miahbits)

After these, if i'm still unemployed, i'll be focusing on writing data structures/algorithms and design patterns implementations, and starting new projects.
