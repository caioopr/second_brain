## Log

Today i worked on some assignments from my university.

### Assignments

The first assignment was from the Machine Learning class, where i had to demonstrate how to make a symbolic-numeric attribute conversion with python. So, for this, i used a books dataset from kaggle, and pandas and numpy to help me to clean/transform the data.

The second was from the Digital Image Process class involving image filters.
