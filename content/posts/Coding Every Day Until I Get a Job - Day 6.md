## Log

Today i only tested a game development library for a side project.

### Side Project

One of my side projects is an Atari 2600 game made with assembly. I've been thinking about the possibility of remaking it for modern platforms (desktop/mobile devices), so i tested the [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) library as a possibly option, since it's quite easy to use and it allows C and C++ code.
