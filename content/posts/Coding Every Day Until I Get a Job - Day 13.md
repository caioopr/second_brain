## Log

Today i worked on an assignment from my university.

### Assignments

The assignment is from the Distributed System class and it requires to build a chat app using MQTTv5. I started it by configuring the environment, which included installing a MQTT broker and choosing a client, so i installed the Eclipse Mosquitto via docker and created a client using Eclipse Paho with Java. After this, i only did some testing.
