## Log
Today i planned the next LeetCode exercises i'll be doing in the futures and started to work on a new unfinished side project.

### LeetCode 
Considering that i was picking random LeetCode exercises to solve, i decided follow a more solid "path". So, after some exploration, i selected the following exercises lists:
- [Top 150 Interview Questions](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/)
- [Graph Theory Problems](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/graph-theory/)
- [Top 50 SQL Problems](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-sql-50/)
- [30 Days of Pandas](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/30-days-of-pandas/)

-------
### Side Project
Since most of the main features of the [Second Brain](https://github.com/caioopr/second_brain) project is already done, i went back to work on my [Ixtore](https://github.com/caioopr/ixtore) side project. As the last lime i worked on it was two months ago, i didn't get too much done because i spent most part of the time reading the code to remember the state of the project, but i did change a repository's method return type, which led to a few broken methods in the service layer (already fixed them).
