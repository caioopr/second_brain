## Log

Today i only worked on a side project open issues.

### Side Project

On my {Second Brain](https://github.com/caioopr/second_brain) project, i kept working on the "Collections" page but implementing the functionality to show the posts of a collection. The way i found to accomplish this, was to pass the name of the collection as a query parameter, so that i could query the posts that belongs to it.
